Brazilians love bossa nova but no one creates it anymore, it takes people from other countries to create masterpieces so we can relive my childhood feelings of listening to a fresh bossa nova - piada nao intencional. The best is that it sounds so much like the most famous ones and not the elevator music everyone associates it with 🙄, completely fills my heart.

I don't know why in all her movies 'her looking at camera and singing' scenes only exist.. really feel sorry for her great song and poor mv 😂",

Listening to you harp on about some new soulmate.. \"She's so perfect\" blah blah blah, Oh, how I wish you'll wake up one day\r\nRun to me, confess your love, at least just let me say: That when I talk to you oh, Cupid walks right through and shoots an arrow through my heart and I sound like a loon, but don't you feel it too? confess I loved you from the start.",

It’s sad that it won’t be our little secret anymore but hey, I just want to say that even if the whole world knows who she is, we still get to flex how long we’ve been fans to her. Of course to laufey, I’m incredibly proud of how popular she had gotten. I will still remember every hour and day that I put your songs on repeat. To the new lauvers out there, you’re not falling behind. thank you for making her songs blow up and I’m so glad that you also get to experience this with us. I truly admire laufey from the start. 🌹",
